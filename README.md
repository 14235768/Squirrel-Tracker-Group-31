We used the data imported from the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data to build this tracker.

There are two main features on this app:
1. Sightings 
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/
3. Map 
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/map/

The app contains these functions:
1. add a new sight 
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/add/
3. update current sight (a single unique squirrel info.)
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/36I-PM-1007-01/
5. general statistics 
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/stats/
7. a map 
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/map/
