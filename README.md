# Squirrel-Tracker-Group-31

This is a Squirrel Tracker Django project (group 31) for IEOR 4501 course

We used the data imported from the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census Data to build this tracker.

There are two main features on this app:
1. Sightings http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/
2. Map http://127.0.0.1:8000/map/

The app contains these functions:
1. add a new sight http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/add/
2. update current sight ex. http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/36I-PM-1007-01/
3. general statistics http://127.0.0.1:8000/sightings/stats/
4. a map http://127.0.0.1:8000/map/
